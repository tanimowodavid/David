          This project is a backend-focused implementation of a Todo API built
          with Flask. Unlike the basic tutorial approaches that use raw SQLite
          queries and Flask sessions, I rebuilt the project from the ground up
          using industry-standard best practices: User Authentication:
          Implemented secure authentication using JWT tokens instead of
          traditional Flask sessions, making the API stateless and
          production-ready. <br /><br />
          Data Modeling: Migrated from raw SQL to SQLAlchemy ORM with
          class-based models, ensuring cleaner, more maintainable, and
          extensible code.
          <br />API Endpoints: Built endpoints for creating, retrieving,
          updating, and deleting todos, with user-based ownership to keep data
          secure and private. <br />Deployment-Ready Structure: The codebase is
          modular and easy to extend, aligning with how production-ready APIs
          are typically structured. Version Control: The project is available on
          my GitHub, demonstrating my workflow, documentation, and ability to
          share code professionally. This project reflects my commitment to
          moving beyond tutorials and building real-world backend systems that
          prioritize security, scalability, and clean architecture. It not only
          strengthened my understanding of Flask but also gave me hands-on
          experience implementing authentication flows and database design that
          recruiters and teams expect in production environments.
