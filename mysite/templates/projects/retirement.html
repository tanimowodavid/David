          This app is a personal finance companion designed to help people take
          control of their financial future. With just a few details — your
          current age, income, spending, savings, retirement age, and an
          estimate of inflation — the app calculates how much you’ll need to
          retire comfortably and how much you should be saving today to get
          there. <br /><br />
          But it doesn’t stop at the numbers. To make the experience more
          engaging and insightful, the app uses AI to generate personalized
          financial advice, tailored to your lifestyle and goals. It even
          recommends a relevant book to help you deepen your understanding of
          money and retirement planning. <br /><br />
          The app visualizes your journey with a projection chart that shows how
          inflation will affect your spending over time, making it clear why
          consistent saving and planning matter. With progress bars, clean
          results cards, and structured advice formatted for readability, the
          app transforms what could be a stressful calculation into an
          interactive, motivating experience. <br /><br />
          Built with Flask and deployed on Render, this project showcases my
          ability to create user-centric applications that combine practical
          functionality with modern design and AI integration. It’s a tool that
          not only informs but also inspires users to take proactive steps
          towards a secure financial future.
